## The Top Programming Language Of 2021: What Will Be The New C++?

<br/>

## Introduction

<br/>

Languages won't be allowed to die (at least not forever). Languages are gonna keep evolving, changing, gaining more and more properties, and making it very hard for a single one to be compared to the other. For example, there will always be new programming languages evolving, but what they will be is a different question. Languages like Javascript, Java, Python, and Ruby might not die, but we still have to wait and see whether or not they will keep up with newer advances and designs.

<br/>

Programming languages are constantly improving with many different features and changes being introduced in the last few years. Programmers need to keep up with all of the latest changes.

<br/>

Honestly, it’s impossible to tell. But what we can do is look at what languages have been popular in the past decade and project what will likely be popular in the future.

What programming language should I learn right now? This is a question that is often asked by programmers who are just starting out. Since there are so many languages to choose from, it’s difficult to know which to learn first.

<br/>

One of the first things that pop up is language industry saturation when it comes to deciding the top best coding languages. It means whatever language you choose from, you should make sure it's based on MVC standards, how much community support it has (that means how quickly you get your answer solved when you get stuck), and obviously how often the updates are being pushed by its author.

<br/>

## Here’s a programming language that worth learning in 2021 to help you stay up to date.

<br/>

1. **JAVASCRIPT**

<br/>

JavaScript is a programming language that is used primarily in web development and is a language that is used in most programming for the internet.

<br/>

Javascript is a wonderful programming language. Essential for making websites functional and has a claimed increased Turing-complete capabilities. We can improve our website with javascript and make it more efficient with advanced js features.

<br/>

Learning Javascript is a very difficult task for beginners and that is why there are so many books and tutorials available online to help you learn Javascript.

<br/>

Because of the popularity of Javascript, many people are looking to learn Javascript. Because of this, there are a lot of things that you need to know about Javascript to become a good Javascript developer. Javascript is a programming language used for writing webpages, server-side scripts, and client-side scripts, you need to learn a lot of things. In this article, we will look at the various ways in which you can become a Javascript developer. We will also look at the various skills that you can develop as a Javascript developer.

<br/>

Javascript is everywhere, by saying everywhere I mean EVERYWHERE. For example, it helps you to do client-side rendering (front end development), server-side rendering (back end development), Mobile/Hybrid development, and much more. You don’t need to master anything else, because you can do anything from just one programming language.

<br/>

## How does Javascript help in Front end development?

<br/>

This is one of the most asked questions from beginners. Well, without this scripting language you can't call yourself a front-end developer. It is the most important skill to have when you are just starting out web programming. As a newbie, vanilla Javascript helps you to understand major concepts like variables, constant, function arrays, objects, and many advanced ES6 features that will put you high in the job market. By learning these concepts you can almost switch to any language. It will taste you the same but only the syntax would be different.

<br/>

#### These are the important concepts to learn in Vanilla Javascript:

<br/>

- Variables, Loops, Functions, Arrays & Array method, Object & its methods, Spread Operators, Events, DOM, ES6 Features, Rest API, Asynchronous Requests, Object literal & deconstruction.

<br/>

## Which Javascript Front end Frameworks to learn in 2021?

<br/>

There are three major frameworks that are consistently evolving in the modern era. These are Angularjs, Reactjs, and ViewJs. AngularJs is developed by Google which is based on the MVC model. ReactJs is from Facebook and many big brands are currently using React for their Front end. Viewjs is another popular javascript framework that has a huge community.

<br/>

#### Which Framework is best for you in 2021?

<br/>

It becomes very tough for new developers to decide which one should they learn and which one they should not. Expert advice would be to go for ReactJs if you don’t have much time and want to build a super cool website with bare minimum knowledge. If you have good command over your HTML, CSS, and basic javascript knowledge, ReactJs is the framework for you. You can carry on the concepts that you have learned from Vanilla javascript for example ES6 features, object deconstruction, arrays method, etc., and can develop a super-fast Single Page Application.

<br/>

Also, ReactJs helps in Mobile Application development. You can use React Native to build almost any mobile application with advanced features and javascript modern concepts.

<br/>

On the other hand, Angular is a much bigger framework. it takes time to learn Angular. So my recommendation is to go for Angular if you have 3 to 4 months to explore because it can take that much time to learn at least the basics.

<br/>

## How does Javascript help in Back end development?

<br/>

Javascript is a scripting language that does not only help in the front end but also the backend. Javascript provides us a framework popularly know as Node.Js which helps in server-side rendering. With the help of Node.js, you can do almost anything you would do with Php, Ruby, Python, or Java. You can do sessions and authentication like user registration, sign in, etc. You can write your logic to connect with a database like MySQL, MongoDB, etc

<br/>

After you got good command over NodeJs, you can excel more into web development with the help of Express.js Express.js, or simply Express is an open-source server-side web application framework written on top of Nodejs. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.

<br/>

## Conclusion

<br/>

If you are a programmer, you might be wondering about the future of programming languages. A lot of people believe that programming languages that do not exist yet will be the top languages in the coming years.

<br/>

In conclusion, it is really exciting to see the progress that has been made in the tech sector, both by the big and small players. And for those like me who are sitting on the fence waiting for a perfect time to start building up that side of our skill-sets, I would recommend that you start to get a bit more comfortable with learning to code by starting with websites. You can still learn almost any programming language you want but JavaScript is the future.
